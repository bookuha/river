## River

River is a Human Monitoring as a Service (HMaaS) platform designed to collect and analyze logs generated by human activities. Its core purpose is to enable detailed tracking of various aspects of a person's life — such as medical conditions, stress levels, physical activity, milestones, and more — through passive or active data collection.

## Stream

Streams are client-side or cloud-hosted applications that act as data agents for River. They continuously generate logs without requiring manual user input, although manual logging is also supported. Each stream adheres to River’s communication conventions and can be built using any technology stack.

## Development Overview

The current development goal is to deliver the initial release (v0.0.1) of both the River backend and a sample Stream client.

### River (Backend API)

The River backend is implemented as a JSON-only Web API using Elixir and Phoenix. The v0.0.1 release will include the following functionality:

1. Accepting and storing basic activity logs for a user

2. Retrieving all stored logs for a given user

### Stream (Client Agent)

Streams are external applications or services that interface with River. For the initial release, a Telegram-based Stream will be implemented with the following features:

1. Allowing users to manually enter logs through Telegram and saving them to River

2. Retrieving and displaying all logs associated with the user
